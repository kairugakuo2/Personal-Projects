        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until combined.</li>
                    <li>Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to press the crumbs down evenly and firmly.</li>
                    <li>Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Keep the oven on.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Add the vanilla extract and mix until incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition until just blended. Do not overmix.</li>
                    <li>Gently fold in the sour cream and heavy cream until fully combined.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake the Cheesecake:</strong>
                <ul>

                    <li>Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan, creating a water bath.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the center is almost set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven with the door slightly open for 1 hour.</li>

                    <li>Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and let it cool to room temperature on a wire rack.</li>
                    <li>Once cooled, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Topping:</strong>
